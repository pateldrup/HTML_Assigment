    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p> 
        The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the <i>abacus</i>. 
        Later, Charles Babbage proposed the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the 
        <strong>first concept of a programmable computer</strong>. 
        His assistant, <em>Ada Lovelace</em>, is often called the 
        <mark>first computer programmer</mark>. 
        Early devices relied on gears, levers, and manual operations. 
        These systems laid the foundation for modern machines. 
        One could say that <q>imagination was the only limit</q> to early computing devices.
    </p>

    <p>
        The evolution from mechanical tools to electronic devices was 
        <ins>revolutionary</ins>. Before this progress, people depended heavily on 
        <del>manual calculations</del>. 
        Machines like the Difference Engine showed how <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>-like 
        logic could be applied long before electricity powered circuits.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The development of computers is divided into <b>five generations</b>. 
        The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, which were large and unreliable. 
        The 2nd generation introduced <i>transistors</i>, making machines smaller and faster. 
        The 3rd generation relied on <strong>integrated circuits</strong>, a breakthrough in technology. 
        By the 4th generation, <em>microprocessors</em> transformed computers into 
        personal devices affordable for many people. 
        Finally, the 5th generation explores <u>artificial intelligence</u> and 
        <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider this simple equation that defines science and technology: 
        E = mc<sup>2</sup>. 
        Similarly, chemistry also plays a role in computing through material science, 
        for example water as H<sub>2</sub>O used in cooling systems. 
        These small formulas show the blending of <strong>physics</strong> and 
        <em>engineering</em> in computing.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by Tim Berners-Lee 
        in the late 20th century. He once said:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
        Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."  
        â€“ <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr> and 
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> were fundamental technologies that 
        allowed computers to communicate. Early networks like ARPANET 
        connected universities and researchers. 
        What started as an experiment soon became a <em>global revolution</em>.

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        Today, computers are <small>smaller than ever</small>, 
        even fitting in our pockets as <strong>smartphones</strong>. 
        We no longer rely on <del>dial-up</del> but instead enjoy 
        <ins>broadband</ins> and fiber-optic connections. 
        Cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality 
        shape how we interact with the world. 
        Many people now depend on the internet for <i>education, business, and healthcare</i>. 
        Truly, the digital era has changed human history forever.

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>
        To display text on a webpage, you can use simple HTML code like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        To copy text on your computer, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.  
        The system will respond with: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>  
        In programming, variables are represented as <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, 
        and <var>z</var>. For example: <code>x = y + z;</code>
    </p>
