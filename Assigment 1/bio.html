    <p>
        Hello! My name is <b>Drup</b>. I am currently learning 
        HTML <b>from scratch</b> and I am really enjoying the process. <br>
        I believe that learning step by step is the key to becoming 
        a good programmer.

        My hobbies include <i>reading books</i>, <u>playing games</u>, 
        and <mark>exploring new technologies</mark>. <br>
        Sometimes I also enjoy solving puzzles and 
        <b>experimenting</b> with <i>new coding projects</i>.

        In the future, my goal is to become a <b>Full Stack Developer</b>. <br>
        I want to master both <i>Frontend</i> and <i>Backend</i> technologies. <br>
        My target is to achieve this within the next <b>2 years</b>. <br>
        Also, I want to contribute to open-source projects and build 
        real-world applications. <br>
        Fun fact: H<sub>2</sub>O is water, and E = mc<sup>2</sup> inspires me 
        to always keep learning!
